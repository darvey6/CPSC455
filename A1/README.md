  date and time
  Trading Card Website!
  For the first assignment, you’ll be creating your own trading card website. This should provide
  you with a gentle introduction to the three technologies that were covered during the workshop
  (HTML, CSS, JS).
  We’re expecting the following:
1) An HTML file that loads a CSS file and a JS file
2) A navbar (should have functioning links to at least a home page (the main page where
   your trading cards are listed), and an about page (brief information about yourself, the
   project, etc.))
3) A form with two text inputs, to take in a name and an image URL, as well as a button to
   add the card to a list, and a button to clear the inputs in the form.
4) A stringified JSON object that holds initial cards (should be prefilled with a card name
   and image URL for when the site loads … and you can parse it into an object) … this is a
   string!
5) A list (likely unordered), made up of cards that contain the card name and image (it
   should be updated with a new card whenever you click the add button in your form).
6) A button to delete all the cards.
7) Sufficient styling (showing some effort to upgrade the site from basic HTML), which may
   include things like:
   ○ Text color
   ○ Background color
   ○ Different positioning
   ○ Sizing (width, height), padding, margins
   ○ Etc.
8) Site should be responsive, and can handle shrinking the web browser or viewing with
   the device emulator in Chrome (expecting a flexbox if appropriate or media queries or at
   least appropriate sizing).
9) Something cool and extra! This is wide open for you to explore, and try to push your
   knowledge and boundaries.
   For example:
- you could have individual buttons for each card that will allow you to delete them
  (a button with an X or that says delete)
- you could have the cards animate in or out of the list when you add or delete
  them (using CSS animations and transitions)
- you could have additional form elements that show up in the cards (e.g. a text
  input for a description of the card or card stats, a dropdown that includes different
  options, etc.)
  As described in the individual assignment rubric, your code will need to meet these
  requirements and be functional, up to perhaps a few minor glitches in tricky cases. Note that
  functionality includes both user-visible and console-visible issues.
  It’s up to you! We’re hoping that you’ll use the above requirements as a guide, but that you’ll let
  your imagination take over, and build something unique and interesting!
  You should be ready to demo this to a TA during your second week lab, and should be ready to
  answer questions about it, as well as explain in detail what you’ve completed.
  HAVE FUN!!!
